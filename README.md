React Atomic Design Pattern

React Atomic Design is a design pattern that provides a structured and scalable approach to building user interfaces in React applications. It is based on the concept of breaking down complex UI components into smaller, reusable building blocks called atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.
Atoms represent the basic UI elements such as buttons, inputs, or icons. These atoms are simple and self-contained, with minimal or no dependencies on other components.

Molecules are combinations of atoms that form more complex components, like a search bar or a navigation menu. Molecules are designed to be reusable and can contain multiple atoms.

Organisms are higher-level components that consist of a combination of atoms and molecules, forming more significant UI elements such as a form or a card. Organisms often have state and can interact with other components.
Templates represent the overall layout and structure of a page. They define the positioning and arrangement of organisms and can be reused across different pages.

Pages are the final layer in the hierarchy and represent the actual views or screens of the application. They are constructed using templates and contain specific content or data.
The React Atomic Design pattern promotes a modular and component-driven approach, enabling developers to build UI components in a more efficient and reusable manner. It encourages the separation of concerns, making it easier to manage and maintain complex React applications by fostering a clear component hierarchy and a consistent design system.
